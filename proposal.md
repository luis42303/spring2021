# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

comicquest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We hope to create a text-based game with visuals, so a visual novel. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our game will allow user input and continue a storyline based on their input. At each conclusion, an image will be shown. We plan to use a lot of if statements.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Khamari Thornton - tul14735@temple.edu - Joanne Nicohls
Mike Dantuono - tun32847@temple.edu - Joanns Nicohls

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would include allowing user input and following a storyline without any faults. A text-based game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Including images would be a better outcome

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to include audio as well.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn how to show images conditionally, as well as including audio conditionally.
