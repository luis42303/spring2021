# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Originally, I had planned to do something along the lines of music or finance, for those are a few interests of mine.
After finding a team, we decided to do a text based game. Music would be a bit challnging, for I think I am overestimating
my abilities, for I have done it in the past.
In the text based game we want to incorporate some images as well.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Khamari Thornton, Micheal Dantuono

## Do you have any questions of your own?

What would be the expectation of a three member team doing a text-based game.
