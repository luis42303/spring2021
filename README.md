The biggest issue we faced during this project was importing images into our program and displaying
them conditionally. We started by looking at the hurricane tracking program to see if we could follow
along the method you used to display the background. However, we had several images we wanted to
display and we wanted them to appear conditionally. Originally, we had hoped to have the images and also 
incorporate audio. We also wanted there to be a restart button so users could play again 
until they reached a desirable outcome. When we had the restart button, the window would not open with 
the image, so we had to remove this feature.

In our submission, another difficulty we faced was having all the images in a zip file so that anyone
with that file would be able to use it without an issue. This meant changing putting the program in 
the same folder as the images and changing the "file=" line in the code. Figuring out how this works
with macs as well as with windows was a challenge for us. Zip file was submitted but also attached in
the comments for the submission
