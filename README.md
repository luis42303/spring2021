The biggest issue we faced during this project was importing images into our program and displaying
them conditionally. Originally, we had hoped to have the images and also incorporate audio. Additionally
we also wanted there to be a restart button so users could play again until they reached a desirable
outcome. When we had the restart button, the window would not open with the image, so we had to remove
this feature.
